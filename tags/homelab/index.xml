      <description>Memory in the homelab. A topic that probably hits everyone. Most of the time CPU resources are sufficient, but memory is usually a bottleneck. My colleague William Lam has tested the new 32GB DIMMs in his Intel NUCs. Link
Unfortunately, William has no generation 7 NUCs. So I thought, take the 300 Euros and test it myself in my environment. I ordered the new DIMMs here.
The installation was super easy and after 10 minutes the new memory was installed.</description>
