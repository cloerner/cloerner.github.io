My name is Christian Loerner. Welcome to my blog.

My carrier at VMware started in early 2016 as a Technical Account Manager in the PSO organization. Prior to that I worked as a senior consultant for several business parters here in Germany. At all I have over 16 years of IT experience. Especially in VMware of course! If you want to know what a TAM does, you can follow this [link.](https://blogs.vmware.com/services-education-insights/2017/11/vmware-technical-account-manager.html)

In all these years I have been able to gain great experience in planning, managing and strategic guidance, which I pass on to customers and companies today.
